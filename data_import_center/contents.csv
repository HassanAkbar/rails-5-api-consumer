Why Rails 5 ?,2019/1/11,DHH,Rails 5 is the future,"Rails 5 was announced on RailsConf past April. David Heinemeier Hansson highlighted a few of the features that we can expect with the new release of Ruby on Rails. He also talked about his vision on how building monolithic Ruby on Rails application is not that bad. You can agree or disagree with David’s opinions, but the truth is that modern Web Applications are more than just HTML and CSS and this is clear in the Ruby on Rails world, proof of this is the inclusion of Rails API and ActionCable. The web has changed and, with it, Ruby on Rails also needs to change. So let us take a quick look at what is changing for the new version, Rails 5.",Draft

Why Cloud Programming?,2019/1/13,Mike Thomas,Cloud is the future,"Cloud computing metaphor: the group of networked elements providing services need not be individually addressed or managed by users; instead, the entire provider-managed suite of hardware and software can be thought of as an amorphous cloud. Cloud computing is shared pools of configurable computer system resources and higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort, often over the Internet. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale, similar to a public utility. Third-party clouds enable organizations to focus on their core businesses instead of expending resources on computer infrastructure and maintenance.[1] Advocates note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand.[1][2][3] Cloud providers typically use a ""pay-as-you-go"" model, which can lead to unexpected operating expenses if administrators are not familiarized with cloud-pricing models.[4] The availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization, service-oriented architecture, and autonomic and utility computing has led to growth in cloud computing.[5][6][7][8]",Published
Machine Learning,2019/1/14,Chris Martin,Rails 5 is the future,"Machine learning and data mining Kernel Machine.svg Problems[show] Supervised learning (classification • regression) [show] Clustering[show] Dimensionality reduction[show] Structured prediction[show] Anomaly detection[show] Artificial neural networks[show] Reinforcement learning[show] Theory[show] Machine-learning venues[show] Glossary of artificial intelligence[show] Related articles[show] Portal-puzzle.svg Machine learning portal vte Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to progressively improve their performance on a specific task. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model of sample data, known as ""training data"", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.[1][2]:2 Machine learning algorithms are used in the applications of email filtering, detection of network intruders, and computer vision, where it is infeasible to develop an algorithm of specific instructions for performing the task. Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a field of study within machine learning, and focuses on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.[3][4] In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.",Draft
